# Summary of outputs

-   `tpm_tables` contains processed gene expression data. There are different versions with different normalisations. These are used as inputs to `desync_python_scripts`.
-   `clustering_and_DE` contains info on differentially expressed genes and related clustering (without pseudotime)
-   `pseudotime` contains outputs related to pseudotime inference and smoothing.
-   `pseudotime_analysis` contains outputs related to area under the curve 
analysis and clustering
-   `network_analysis` contains outputs related to gene regulatory network inference
-   `variant_calling` contains outputs related to variants, including filtered vcf files, phylogenies, and linear models.
