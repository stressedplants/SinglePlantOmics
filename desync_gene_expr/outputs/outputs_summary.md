# Summary of outputs

These folders separate the outputs (i.e. anything produced by the code that is not an image).

-   `tpm_tables` contains processed gene expression data. There are different versions with different normalisations.
-   `clustering_and_DE` contains info on differentially expressed genes and related clustering (without pseudotime)
-   `pseudotime` contains outputs related to pseudotime inference.
-   `pseudotime_analysis` contains downstream analysis of pseudotime results
-   `network_analysis` contains outputs related to GRN inference
