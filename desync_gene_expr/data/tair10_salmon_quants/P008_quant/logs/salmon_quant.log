[2022-01-30 19:33:33.707] [jointLog] [info] Counted 37,572,168 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-01-30 19:33:33.730] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000171527% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
