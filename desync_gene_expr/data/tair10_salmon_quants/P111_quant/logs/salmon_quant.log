[2022-01-30 21:00:52.643] [jointLog] [info] Counted 48,430,357 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-01-30 21:00:52.665] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000360328% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
